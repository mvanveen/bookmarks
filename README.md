## bookmarks

- this is my quick and dirty attempt to build a del.icio.us / pinboard style 
  bookmark manager that I can self-host

goals:

- good, automated archival of bookmarks
- something suitable for self-host
- use as much AI as I can to make everything quickly

anti-goals:

- making something for someone else
- making something high code quality
